# Lifter_Sheets

In this small project I created I had a little fun with Python, JS, HTML and CSS. 
I created a very basic HTML web page which is used to insert your weightlifting results.
Then I created a sample of results in Excell file which I uploaded on my Google Drive. I automated the insertion of data 
gathered from Google Drive XML file results via Google Drive rest API. After the table in HTML file fills with data it runs a
test which compares data in XML file with the data that was just printed live on a web page.
